0.4.2 Update Notes:
- Reworked the Titan Rock, Acheron, Arterius and Ghastly Ent AIs.
- Reworked Titan Rock, Acheron and Arterius weapons.
- Essences renamed to wisps to avoid confusion with other mods
- Wisps (enemies) were removed, giving place to new unique enemies for each wisp (item):
	. Nightly Owl
	. Desert Totem
	. Soaring Pecker and Infection Fly
	. Undead Heart
	(If you still need wisps for some strange reason, they can be spawned in with cheat sheet)
- Ore spawners have been removed, ores will spawn after you kill their respective boss (on pre-existing worlds this may or may not work)
- The three gems included with the mod, citrine, tourmaline and spinel are now found rarely in marble, granite and ash respectively, but can still by dropped by vanilla enemies

- Rebalanced various items and updated their sprites
- Boss Checklist progression positions have been fixed, along with the lack of a summon item for Acheron
- Acheron and Arterius have recieved new soundtracks
- Spiritflame has been moved to the Post-Golem Hallow, if you currently have spiritflame it will have the golem-tier damage rates, so you may want to save it for later
- The Ghastly Ent now drops its loot in normal mode and has had changes regarding its loot table
- An assortment of random items, ranging from a mount dropped by Acheron, an upgrade to gel as ammo and a very early game hook made with rope
- Dragonfire Blades can now change mode via right clicking while in hand, although this can still be done with crafting
- All enemies have banners, along with four decorative wisp ones crafted with their respective wisps
